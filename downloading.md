1. Create a folder in your home directory called 'Downloads' if you don't have one already.
2. Create a subfolder called 'NASS' in that directory.
3. Download and unzip the NASS archive (<http://challengefiles2.blob.core.windows.net/dbcsv/NASS.zip>) to the 'NASS' subfolder.
4. Download and unzip the ARMSDB archive (<http://challengefiles2.blob.core.windows.net/dbcsv/ARMSDB.zip>) to the 'NASS' subfolder.
